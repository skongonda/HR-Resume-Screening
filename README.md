# HR-Resume-Screening

"""
This application leverages Pinecone and Langchain to assist in resume screening by matching candidate resumes to a provided job description. Users upload resumes in PDF format, which are then converted to text and stored in a vector store. Using advanced embedding techniques and a unique identifier, the code evaluates the relevance of each resume to the job description and returns the best matches. This process ensures a streamlined and efficient resume screening experience, helping recruiters find the most suitable candidates for the job.
